# Hi, I'm Tristan

## About me
I'm a 21-year-old student currently studying Information Technology at EPHEC, Louvain-la-Neuve. I have a passion for learning and building projects that challenge my skills and creativity. I’m currently working on a flashcard application as part of a development course. On this GitHub, you'll find some of the work I’ve done, ranging from coding projects to problem-solving exercises. Feel free to explore and connect!
